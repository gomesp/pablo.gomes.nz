{"name":"Pablo's blog","tagline":"","body":"Hi #NZSecretSanta! I have 2 lovely kids: a 5 (and a half) year old boy (Lucas) and a 3 year old girl (Malou). Could you make them believe in Santa please?\r\n\r\nMy son loves anything that goes fast. And he just discovered the world of Star Wars. He loves super-heroes, specially the Hulk. But he also loves Superman, Spider-man, Iron-man. And he's also quite a bookworm.\r\n\r\nMy daughter is Dora's biggest fan in the entire world. Anything Dora related will get much love and plenty of smiles.\r\n\r\nThanks for making my kids believing in Santa for a little longer. That's the best present I could get. :) ","google":"UA-681782-12","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
