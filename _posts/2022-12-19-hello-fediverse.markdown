The recent events happening at Twitter have put me off the platform, at least for now. 

Twitter 2.0 is a place fuelled by misinformation, racism and misogyny and I do not want to be part of that. This is a real shame because I have made a few like-minded friends via Twitter and I am hoping all of them transition to Mastodon or another social media platform. I have shifted my social media presence away from Twitter and onto Mastodon. 

From now on you can find me at `@pablo@pablo.gomes.nz` which is an alias to `@pablo@mastodon.nz`.
