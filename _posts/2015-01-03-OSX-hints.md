OS X is able to read NTFS-formatted hard drives, but it disables writing by default. It is possible to enable read+write on NTFS hard drives on OS X using [third-party software][2] or by enabling each volume in the fstab as below.

```
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

The following line should be added (where NAME corresponds to your volume name):

```
LABEL=NAME none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse
```

The drive is not listed in the list of volumes in Finder anymore. Instead we need to browse to it via the Terminall.app.

```
open /Volumes
```

To eject the drive we can use diskutil. Note that the device id may be different.

{% highlight bash %}
#List the attached devices
diskutil list 
#Unmount a device
diskutil unmount /dev/disk1s1
{% endhighlight %}
