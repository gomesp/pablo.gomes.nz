Hi #NZSecretSanta! I have 2 lovely kids: a 5 (and a half) year old boy (Lucas) and a 3 year old girl (Malou). Could you make them believe in Santa please?

My son loves anything that goes fast. And he just discovered the world of Star Wars. He loves super-heroes, specially the Hulk. But he also loves Superman, Spider-man, Iron-man. And he's also quite a bookworm.

My daughter is Dora's biggest fan in the entire world. Anything Dora related will get much love and plenty of smiles. Or things to paint with, things to draw with (or on). Colouring books are awesome, and paint is great for messy play!

Thanks for making my kids believing in Santa for a little longer. That's the best present I could get. :)
