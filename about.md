Just some random person on the Internet. I like to [tweet](http://twitter.com/pablogl) and take [photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gomesp).

I love programming, doing mostly enterprise projects. One of the objectives of starting this blog is to encourage me to contribute to open-source, eventually.

If you need to tell me a secret, please use [Keybase](https://keybase.io/gomesp).
