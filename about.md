I'm just another random person on the Internet that [tweets](http://twitter.com/pablogl) and takes [photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gomesp), but not of my breakfast.

In real life I'm just a person, standing in front of my bike, asking her to take me for a ride. I wish I didn't need to be a bicycle activist just to get a safe ride to work or so that my children would cycle safe to school.
