I'm just another random person on the Internet that [tweets](http://twitter.com/pablogl) and takes [photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gomesp), but not of my breakfast.

In real life [I'm just a boy, standing in front of a bike, asking her to love me and take me for a ride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAXutxWX7GI). 

I wish I didn't need to be a bicycle activist just to get a safe ride to work or so that my children would cycle safe to school.
